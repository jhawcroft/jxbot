IMPORTANT ENGINEERING NOTES
===========================

String Character Encodings
--------------------------

PHP's support for string character encodings is far from ideal, for historical reasons,
in part.

As PHP is engineered around byte-oriented strings, ALL text within JxBot is represented
using UTF-8.

Utilities are explicitly provided (see nl.php) for all the types of text manipulation 
operations likely to be encountered in this software.  They will be used for clarity.


Intermediate-Internal Pattern Format (IIPF)
-------------------------------------------

For internal reasons, AIML patterns are not stored as-is within the pattern tree 
in the database.

Pattern-side elements, such as <bot name="..."/> and <set>...</set> are translated into
a flat, non-XML format for optimal internal use.  Bot properties are represented by a
colon (:) followed by the property name, and sets, the set name followed by a colon.
For example:

	<bot>name</bot>    =>    :name
	<set>colors</set>  =>    colors:

Other operations performed during input normalisation are applied, such that IIPF strings
resemble normalised input.
For example:

	HELLO :name DO YOU LIKE colors:

Matches:

	Hello JxBot, do you like red?
