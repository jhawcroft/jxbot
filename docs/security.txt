Admin Security
----

Core
----

-	log admin logins
-	record originating IP (which may be spoofed
	or change frequently for some users) in log
-	record user agent as part of session ID check
-	ensure sessions expire when inactive
-	prevent frequent login attempts to same account
-	provide advisory on using SSL/TLS


Todo Soon
---------

-	forgot password



Other Ideas
-----------

-	disallow multiple simultaneous admin logins
	(maybe if we go multi-user)
-	notify admin of frequent login attempts
	periodically
-	be sure to check usability on mobile
	where IP may change very frequently
	(eg. every request)
