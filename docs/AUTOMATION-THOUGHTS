Reasons for AI work on better learning algorithms for grammar:
===

* Maintenance burden; maintaining AIML is quite time consuming,
such a system would relegate most direct maintenance to the automated system
and allow indirect manipulation through training interactions only.

* Faster to get started; initial development and training can be significantly
less than what would be required with AIML, since patterns are already 
generalised, and generalisations can be automatically tagged and downloaded
for turn-key startup of future blank systems.



Similarity & grammar analysis / public-guided training
===

-	word similarity index on a set of common descriptions and common nouns and actions
	in particular opposites and also inappropriate language, such that if a user
	suggests a better way of saying something, it can be checked there and then to
	see that it is believable.
	
-	statistical determinations of metrics

-	words automatically identified as primarily conjunctive

-	identification of syntax parameters in parameterised syntax

-	identification of 'flags' such as inverters, like NOT, that have a significant
	impact on the meaning

-	possibly parse in stages, left to right, as fragments generally involving 
	a verb, subject and object, and possible adornments, such as adverbs and
	adjectives.

-	connective words would actually build connective meaning structures potentially

-	moving more toward syntactic parsing, with exceptions for common but 
	non-complete statements, such HOW ARE YOU?
