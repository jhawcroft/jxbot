Admin Security
----

Core
----

-	log admin logins [DONE]
-	ensure sessions expire when inactive [DONE]
-	prevent frequent login attempts to same account [DONE]
-	provide advisory on using SSL/TLS


Todo Soon
---------

-	forgot password recovery via admin email
-	add multiple admin users?



Other Ideas
-----------

-	consider using a 3rd party library/login system
-	record user agent as part of session ID check
-	disallow multiple simultaneous admin logins
	(maybe if we go multi-user)
-	notify admin of frequent login attempts
	periodically
-	be sure to check usability on mobile
	where IP may change very frequently
	(eg. every request)
-	record originating IP (which may be spoofed
	or change frequently for some users) in log ?
