JxBot
=====

JxBot is a simple web-based conversational agent - a chat robot.  It is currently [AIML-based](http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html) and built atop PHP and MySQL.

JxBot can handle moderately complex conversation with users in a natural language, such as English.  The software forms the platform and infrastructure upon which your unique domain/problem specific bot personality runs.
