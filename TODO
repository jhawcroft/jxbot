TODO
====

Essentials (toward a version 1.0)
----------

* Implement error handling and check for common data malformations
* Fix obvious bugs
  * Registration of THAT and TOPIC; which currently require category UPDATEs
    and for example, during AIML loading, are not working correctly.
* Get installer to ask for admin username & any other pertinent settings
* Continue cleaning up [PROGRESSING]

---


* implement substitutions in normalisation
* Improvements to database admin; pandora-bots as a model UI?
* consider adding 'Tags' wherein information that is usually filtered out, such as punctuation,
  laughter, etc. is picked up and converted to 'tags' which are applied to the sentence,
  and which are accessible via a custom <tag> or predicate relative to each sentence / the whole thing (index=)
  * tags could be a map too, ie. search string => tag name
* 'spelling' separate substitution map

* have age and birthday special bot predicates, with age auto-calculated [DONE]
* Substitution maintenance [maps, DONE] - use whitespace prefixed & postfix'd content, prior to punctuation norm
* Finish set functionality [DONE]

---

* Write documentation
* Write sample AIML, possibly to be preloaded with new bots


Roadmap
-------

* 1.1 - implement some kind of cache
* Remaining AIML v2 features?
  * date formats
  * learn, learnf, eval
  * loop
  * interval

* checks for questions and provides a question flag/predicate to aid
  writing creative responses to unknown statements



Server Configuration
--------------------

* check setting of session.gc_maxlifetime
  and write a note in documentation about this, 
  as well as JxBot session handling + integration with other
  3rd-party systems, eg. Wordpress
