Essentials (toward a version 1.0)
----------

* Implement error handling and check for common data malformations
* Fix obvious bugs
  * Registration of THAT and TOPIC; which currently require category UPDATEs
    and for example, during AIML loading, are not working correctly.
* Get installer to ask for admin username & any other pertinent settings
* Continue cleaning up [PROGRESSING]

---


* consider adding 'Tags' wherein information that is usually filtered out, such as punctuation,
  laughter, etc. is picked up and converted to 'tags' which are applied to the sentence,
  and which are accessible via a custom <tag> or predicate relative to each sentence / the whole thing (index=)
  * tags could be a map too, ie. search string => tag name
* 'spelling' separate substitution map [DONE]

* have age and birthday special bot predicates, with age auto-calculated [DONE]
* Substitution maintenance [maps, DONE] - use whitespace prefixed & postfix'd content, prior to punctuation norm
* Finish set functionality [DONE]
* implement substitutions in normalisation [DONE]

* Improvements to database admin; pandora-bots as a model UI?

---

* Write documentation
* Write sample AIML, possibly to be preloaded with new bots
* provide historical stats & dash information


Roadmap
-------

* 1.1 - implement some kind of cache
* Remaining AIML v2 features?
  * date formats
  * learn, learnf, eval
  * loop
  * interval

* checks for questions and provides a question flag/predicate to aid
  writing creative responses to unknown statements
  
* potentially things like web addresses and dates
  could be tagged and prevented from the usual normalisation,
  and required to match a wildcard/built-in set
  which would make this side of things a bit neater



Server Configuration
--------------------

* check setting of session.gc_maxlifetime
  and write a note in documentation about this, 
  as well as JxBot session handling + integration with other
  3rd-party systems, eg. Wordpress
  
  
Normalisation Sequence
----------------------

-	split sentences - (AIML 1 has this below substitutions but it shouldn't matter too much; can review later)
-	apply `tags` to sentences
-	run spelling corrections? 
-	run substitutions
	(abbreviations, contractions, etc.)
-	strip punctuation & accents (if required) & split into words & uppercase

There may be performance issues with the AIML 1 proposed normalisation sequence.  It's essentially got to be run rule by rule.
To be reviewed later.
Spelling might be better processed in a different way.
