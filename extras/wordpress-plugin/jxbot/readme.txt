A widget for chatting with a locally hosted JxBot.

== Description ==

The JxBot widget for Wordpress allows you to let visitors to your site chat with a locally hosted JxBot chatterbot.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Appearance > Widgets screen to add the widget to your site.
4. Put the full URL to your bot's ajax gateway installation in the widget configuration, for example: http://my-site.com/jxbot/ajax.php
5. Test your site!

You should probably test that URL yourself before installing the plugin, to make sure you have the URL correct and your JxBot instance is installed correctly.  Simply visit the URL in your web browser and confirm you receive your robot's greeting message.
